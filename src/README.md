# maze.cpp

## By Derfel Terciano

This project is to demonstrate my `C++` skills! Here, we build a simple maze generator and solver. However, we build upon this by
making a visualizer for the maze using `SFML`. 

I wanted to practice my Data Structures and Algorithms concepts by making a project that directly uses them. With that said,
the underlying operations rely strictly on the data structures and algorithms implemented in `include/`.
